  Abstract                 = {CePt3Si exhibits antiferromagnetic order at TN ≈ 2.2 K and superconductivity (SC) at Tc ≈ 0.75 K. Large values of H{\textasciiacutex}c2 ≈ −8.5 T/K and Hc2(0) ≈ 5 T indicate Cooper pairs formed out of heavy quasiparticles. The mass enhancement originates from Kondo interaction with a characteristic temperature TK ≈ 8 K. NMR and $\mu$SR measurements evidence coexistence of SC and long-range magnetic order on a microscopic scale. Moreover, CePt3Si is the first heavy-fermion SC without an inversion symmetry. This gives rise to a novel type of the NMR relaxation rate 1/T1 never reported before for other heavy-fermion superconductors. Studies of Si/Ge substitution allow us to establish a phase diagram.},

     abstract = {We derive a precise mathematical connection between the 
strong-coupling regime of the Abelian lattice gauge theory in four 
dimensions and a lattice model of a superconductor. This connection 
relates the quark confinement of the lattice gauge theory to magnetic 
flux tubes in the superconductor, along lines conjectured earlier by 
Mandelstam and 't Hooft. We apply this relation to the study of the 
behavior of physical quantities in the vicinity of the transition of the 
gauge theory to its quark-confining phase. In the course of our 
arguments, we develop an analogous connection between models describing 
a superconductor and a ferromagnet in three dimensions; this analysis 
reveals a new second-order phase transition in a superconductor which 
may be interpreted as a Gell-Mann-Low eigenvalue in (2 + 1)-dimensional 
scalar QED. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

  Abstract                 = {The search for broken time-reversal symmetry (time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB)) in unconventional superconductors has intensified in the past few years as more systems have been predicted to possess such a state. Following our pioneering study of TRSB states in Sr 2 RuO 4 using magneto-optic probes, we embarked on a systematic study of several other of these candidate systems. The primary instrument for our studies is the Sagnac magneto-optic interferometer that we recently developed. This instrument can measure magneto-optic Faraday or Kerr effects with an unprecedented sensitivity of 10 nrad at temperatures as low as 100 mK. In this paper, we review our recent studies of TRSB in several systems, emphasizing the study of the pseudogap state of high temperature superconductors and the inverse proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet proximity structures.},

  abstract = {Although the properties of most superconducting materials are well described by the theory1 of Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS), considerable effort has been devoted to the search for exotic superconducting systems in which BCS theory does not apply. The transition to the superconducting state in conventional BCS superconductors involves the breaking of gauge symmetry only, whereby the wavefunction describing the Cooper pairs---the paired electron states responsible for superconductivity---adopt a definite phase. In contrast, a signature of an unconventional superconducting state is the breaking of additional symmetries2, which can lead to anisotropic pairing (such as the `d-wave' symmetry observed in the copper oxide superconductors) and the presence of multiple superconducting phases (as seen in UPt3 and analogous behaviour in superfluid 3He; 3--5). Here we report muon spin-relaxation measurements on the superconductor Sr2RuO4 that reveal the spontaneous appearance of an internal magnetic field below the transition temperature: the appearance of such a field indicates that the superconducting state in this material is characterized by the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. These results, combined with other symmetry considerations, suggest that superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 is of `p-wave' (odd-parity) type, analogous to superfluid 3He.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a general theory of the spin dynamics of anisotropic Fermi superfluids of the generalized BCS type, under conditions which should be realistic for any such phase of liquid 3He occurring below 3 mK. No restrictions are placed on the nature of the pairing configuration. The system is described in terms of the total spin vector S, and a vector T(n) which describes the amplitude and spin quantization axes of the pairs forming at a given point n on the Fermi surface; the kinematic relations between these quantities are emphasized. An approximation of the Born-Oppenheimer type is used to derive the general equations of motion of S and T; it is pointed out that relaxation of T due to collisions is inhibited by the coherent nature of the superfluid state. The equations of motion are solved for the particular case of unsaturated c.w. resonance, and it is shown that the nature of the transverse (usual) resonance spectrum is a strong function of the kind of configuration occurring; in particular, either one or two finite-frequency resonances may occur, depending on the configuration. A resonance is also predicted to occur when the r.f. field is polarized along the static external field. Specific predictions of the form of the transverse and “longitudinal” spectra are made for all the unitary l = 1 states, and it is shown that these predictions are unaffected by renormalization effects. The “Balian-Werthamer” state is predicted to show a longitudinal resonance but no transverse shift. The theory is compared with other approaches to the problem and its relevance to the anomalous low-temperature phases of liquid 3He is discussed.},

Besides domain walls separating different chiral states, chiral p-wave state supports both singular and coreless vortices also interpreted as skyrmions. Here, we present a numerical study of the energetic properties of isolated singular and coreless vortex states as functions of anisotropy and magnetic field penetration length. In a given chiral state, single quantum vortices with opposite winding have different energies and thus only one kind is energetically favoured. We find that with the appropriate sign of the phase winding, two-quanta (coreless) vortices are always energetically preferred over two isolated single quanta (singular) vortices. We also report solutions carrying more flux quanta. However those are typically more energetically expensive/metastable as compared to those carrying two flux quanta.},

Of particular interest are unconventional superconductors that break time-reversal symmetry, for which the superconducting state is protected topologically and vortices can host Majorana fermions with potential use in quantum computing3,4. However, in striking contrast to the unconventional A phase of superfluid 3He where chiral symmetry was directly observed5, identification of broken time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, a key component of chiral symmetry, has presented a challenge in bulk materials. The two leading candidates for bulk chiral superconductors are UPt3 (refs.{\thinspace}6--8) and Sr2RuO4 (ref.{\thinspace}9), although evidence for broken time-reversal symmetry comes largely from surface-sensitive measurements. A long-sought demonstration of broken time-reversal symmetry in bulk Sr2RuO4 is the observation of edge currents, which has so far not been successful10. The situation for UPt3 is not much better. Here, we use vortices to probe the superconducting state in ultraclean crystals of UPt3. Using small-angle neutron scattering, a strictly bulk probe, we demonstrate that the vortices possess an internal degree of freedom in one of its three superconducting phases, providing direct evidence for bulk broken time-reversal symmetry in this material.},

  abstract  = {Superconductors exhibit unconventional electronic and magnetic properties if the Cooper pair wave function breaks additional symmetries of the normal phase. Rotational symmetries in spin and orbital spaces, as well as discrete symmetries such as space and time inversion, may be spontaneously broken. When this occurs in conjunction with broken global U(1) gauge symmetry, new physical phenomena are exhibited below the superconducting transition that are characteristic of the broken symmetries of the pair condensate. This is particularly true of vortices and related defects. Superconductors with a multi-component order parameter exhibit a variety of different vortex structures and closely related defects that are not possible in condensates belonging to a one-dimensional (1D) representation. In this paper, we discuss the structure of vortices in fermionic superfluids and superconductors which break chiral symmetry, i.e. combined broken time inversion and 2D parity. In particular, we consider the structure of vortices and defects that might be realized in thin films of 3He-A and the layered superconductor Sr2RuO4, and identify some of the characteristic signatures of broken chiral symmetry that should be revealed by these defects.},

The feature common to all of these materials is a layered crystal structure based on a perovskite template and containing planar networks of copper and oxygen. This raises the question of whether superconductivity can occur in layered perovskites that do not contain copper. To the best of our knowledge, no such material has been found to date, despite nearly a decade of searching. We describe here the discovery of superconductivity in Sr2RuO4, a layered perovskite isostructural with La2−xBaxCuO4 (Fig. 1). Our results demonstrate that the presence of copper is not a prerequisite for the existence of superconductivity in a layered perovskite. But the low value of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc = 0.93 K) points towards a special role for copper in the high-temperature superconductors.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity --- one of the best understood many-body problems in physics --- has again become a challenge following the discovery of unconventional superconducting materials: these include heavy-fermion1, organic2 and the high-transition-temperature copper oxide3 superconductors. In conventional superconductors, the electrons form superconducting Cooper pairs in a spin-singlet state, which has zero total spin (S = 0). In principle, Cooper pairs can also form in a spin-triplet state (S = 1), analogous to the spin-triplet `p-wave' state of paired neutral fermions in superfluid 3He (ref. 4). At present, the heavy-fermion compound UPt3 is the only known spin-triplet superconductor5,6, although the layered oxide superconductor Sr2RuO4 (ref. 7) is believed, on theoretical grounds8, to be a promising candidate. The most direct means of identifying the spin state of Cooper pairs is from measurements of their spin susceptibility, which can be determined by the Knight shift (as probed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)). Here we report Knight-shift measurements of Sr2RuO2 using 17O NMR. Our results show no change in spin susceptibility on passing through the superconducting transition temperature, which provides the definitive identification of Sr2RuO4 as a spin-triplet superconductor.},

  abstract = {In this short review, we aim to provide a topical update on the status of efforts to understand the superconductivity of Sr2RuO4. We concentrate on efforts to identify a superconducting order parameter symmetry that is compatible with all the major pieces of experimental knowledge of the material, and highlight some major discrepancies that have become even clearer in recent years. As the pun in the title suggests, we have tried to start the discussion from scratch, making no assumptions even about fundamental issues such as the parity of the superconducting state. We conclude that no consensus is currently achievable in Sr2RuO4, and that the reasons for this go to the heart of how well some of the key probes of unconventional superconductivity are really understood. This is, therefore, a puzzle that merits continued in-depth study.},

  abstract = {Phases of matter are usually identified through spontaneous symmetry breaking, especially regarding unconventional superconductivity and the interactions from which it originates. In that context, the superconducting state of the quasi-two-dimensional and strongly correlated perovskite Sr2RuO4 is considered to be the only solid-state analogue to the superfluid 3He-A phase1,2, with an odd-parity order parameter that is unidirectional in spin space for all electron momenta and breaks time-reversal symmetry. This characterization was recently called into question by a search for an expected `split' transition in a Sr2RuO4 crystal under in-plane uniaxial pressure, which failed to find any such evidence; instead, a dramatic rise and a peak in a single-transition temperature were observed3,4. Here we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of oxygen-17, which is directly sensitive to the order parameter via hyperfine coupling to the electronic spin degrees of freedom, to probe the nature of superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 and its evolution under strain. A reduction of the Knight shift is observed for all strain values and at temperatures below the critical temperature, consistent with a drop in spin polarization in the superconducting state. In unstrained samples, our results contradict a body of previous NMR work reporting no change in the Knight shift5 and the most prevalent theoretical interpretation of the order parameter as a chiral p-wave state. Sr2RuO4 is an extremely clean layered perovskite and its superconductivity emerges from a strongly correlated Fermi liquid, and our work imposes tight constraints on the order parameter symmetry of this archetypal system.},
