  Abstract                 = {CePt3Si exhibits antiferromagnetic order at TN ≈ 2.2 K and superconductivity (SC) at Tc ≈ 0.75 K. Large values of H{\textasciiacutex}c2 ≈ −8.5 T/K and Hc2(0) ≈ 5 T indicate Cooper pairs formed out of heavy quasiparticles. The mass enhancement originates from Kondo interaction with a characteristic temperature TK ≈ 8 K. NMR and $\mu$SR measurements evidence coexistence of SC and long-range magnetic order on a microscopic scale. Moreover, CePt3Si is the first heavy-fermion SC without an inversion symmetry. This gives rise to a novel type of the NMR relaxation rate 1/T1 never reported before for other heavy-fermion superconductors. Studies of Si/Ge substitution allow us to establish a phase diagram.},

@article{Peskin1978,
     abstract = {We derive a precise mathematical connection between the 
strong-coupling regime of the Abelian lattice gauge theory in four 
dimensions and a lattice model of a superconductor. This connection 
relates the quark confinement of the lattice gauge theory to magnetic 
flux tubes in the superconductor, along lines conjectured earlier by 
Mandelstam and 't Hooft. We apply this relation to the study of the 
behavior of physical quantities in the vicinity of the transition of the 
gauge theory to its quark-confining phase. In the course of our 
arguments, we develop an analogous connection between models describing 
a superconductor and a ferromagnet in three dimensions; this analysis 
reveals a new second-order phase transition in a superconductor which 
may be interpreted as a Gell-Mann-Low eigenvalue in (2 + 1)-dimensional 
scalar QED. {\textcopyright} 1978.},

  Abstract                 = {The search for broken time-reversal symmetry (time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB)) in unconventional superconductors has intensified in the past few years as more systems have been predicted to possess such a state. Following our pioneering study of TRSB states in Sr 2 RuO 4 using magneto-optic probes, we embarked on a systematic study of several other of these candidate systems. The primary instrument for our studies is the Sagnac magneto-optic interferometer that we recently developed. This instrument can measure magneto-optic Faraday or Kerr effects with an unprecedented sensitivity of 10 nrad at temperatures as low as 100 mK. In this paper, we review our recent studies of TRSB in several systems, emphasizing the study of the pseudogap state of high temperature superconductors and the inverse proximity effect in superconductor/ferromagnet proximity structures.},

  abstract = {Although the properties of most superconducting materials are well described by the theory1 of Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS), considerable effort has been devoted to the search for exotic superconducting systems in which BCS theory does not apply. The transition to the superconducting state in conventional BCS superconductors involves the breaking of gauge symmetry only, whereby the wavefunction describing the Cooper pairs---the paired electron states responsible for superconductivity---adopt a definite phase. In contrast, a signature of an unconventional superconducting state is the breaking of additional symmetries2, which can lead to anisotropic pairing (such as the `d-wave' symmetry observed in the copper oxide superconductors) and the presence of multiple superconducting phases (as seen in UPt3 and analogous behaviour in superfluid 3He; 3--5). Here we report muon spin-relaxation measurements on the superconductor Sr2RuO4 that reveal the spontaneous appearance of an internal magnetic field below the transition temperature: the appearance of such a field indicates that the superconducting state in this material is characterized by the breaking of time-reversal symmetry. These results, combined with other symmetry considerations, suggest that superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 is of `p-wave' (odd-parity) type, analogous to superfluid 3He.},

  abstract = {In this paper we develop a general theory of the spin dynamics of anisotropic Fermi superfluids of the generalized BCS type, under conditions which should be realistic for any such phase of liquid 3He occurring below 3 mK. No restrictions are placed on the nature of the pairing configuration. The system is described in terms of the total spin vector S, and a vector T(n) which describes the amplitude and spin quantization axes of the pairs forming at a given point n on the Fermi surface; the kinematic relations between these quantities are emphasized. An approximation of the Born-Oppenheimer type is used to derive the general equations of motion of S and T; it is pointed out that relaxation of T due to collisions is inhibited by the coherent nature of the superfluid state. The equations of motion are solved for the particular case of unsaturated c.w. resonance, and it is shown that the nature of the transverse (usual) resonance spectrum is a strong function of the kind of configuration occurring; in particular, either one or two finite-frequency resonances may occur, depending on the configuration. A resonance is also predicted to occur when the r.f. field is polarized along the static external field. Specific predictions of the form of the transverse and “longitudinal” spectra are made for all the unitary l = 1 states, and it is shown that these predictions are unaffected by renormalization effects. The “Balian-Werthamer” state is predicted to show a longitudinal resonance but no transverse shift. The theory is compared with other approaches to the problem and its relevance to the anomalous low-temperature phases of liquid 3He is discussed.},

Besides domain walls separating different chiral states, chiral p-wave state supports both singular and coreless vortices also interpreted as skyrmions. Here, we present a numerical study of the energetic properties of isolated singular and coreless vortex states as functions of anisotropy and magnetic field penetration length. In a given chiral state, single quantum vortices with opposite winding have different energies and thus only one kind is energetically favoured. We find that with the appropriate sign of the phase winding, two-quanta (coreless) vortices are always energetically preferred over two isolated single quanta (singular) vortices. We also report solutions carrying more flux quanta. However those are typically more energetically expensive/metastable as compared to those carrying two flux quanta.},

Of particular interest are unconventional superconductors that break time-reversal symmetry, for which the superconducting state is protected topologically and vortices can host Majorana fermions with potential use in quantum computing3,4. However, in striking contrast to the unconventional A phase of superfluid 3He where chiral symmetry was directly observed5, identification of broken time-reversal symmetry of the superconducting order parameter, a key component of chiral symmetry, has presented a challenge in bulk materials. The two leading candidates for bulk chiral superconductors are UPt3 (refs.{\thinspace}6--8) and Sr2RuO4 (ref.{\thinspace}9), although evidence for broken time-reversal symmetry comes largely from surface-sensitive measurements. A long-sought demonstration of broken time-reversal symmetry in bulk Sr2RuO4 is the observation of edge currents, which has so far not been successful10. The situation for UPt3 is not much better. Here, we use vortices to probe the superconducting state in ultraclean crystals of UPt3. Using small-angle neutron scattering, a strictly bulk probe, we demonstrate that the vortices possess an internal degree of freedom in one of its three superconducting phases, providing direct evidence for bulk broken time-reversal symmetry in this material.},

  abstract  = {Superconductors exhibit unconventional electronic and magnetic properties if the Cooper pair wave function breaks additional symmetries of the normal phase. Rotational symmetries in spin and orbital spaces, as well as discrete symmetries such as space and time inversion, may be spontaneously broken. When this occurs in conjunction with broken global U(1) gauge symmetry, new physical phenomena are exhibited below the superconducting transition that are characteristic of the broken symmetries of the pair condensate. This is particularly true of vortices and related defects. Superconductors with a multi-component order parameter exhibit a variety of different vortex structures and closely related defects that are not possible in condensates belonging to a one-dimensional (1D) representation. In this paper, we discuss the structure of vortices in fermionic superfluids and superconductors which break chiral symmetry, i.e. combined broken time inversion and 2D parity. In particular, we consider the structure of vortices and defects that might be realized in thin films of 3He-A and the layered superconductor Sr2RuO4, and identify some of the characteristic signatures of broken chiral symmetry that should be revealed by these defects.},

The feature common to all of these materials is a layered crystal structure based on a perovskite template and containing planar networks of copper and oxygen. This raises the question of whether superconductivity can occur in layered perovskites that do not contain copper. To the best of our knowledge, no such material has been found to date, despite nearly a decade of searching. We describe here the discovery of superconductivity in Sr2RuO4, a layered perovskite isostructural with La2−xBaxCuO4 (Fig. 1). Our results demonstrate that the presence of copper is not a prerequisite for the existence of superconductivity in a layered perovskite. But the low value of the superconducting transition temperature (Tc = 0.93 K) points towards a special role for copper in the high-temperature superconductors.},

  abstract = {Superconductivity --- one of the best understood many-body problems in physics --- has again become a challenge following the discovery of unconventional superconducting materials: these include heavy-fermion1, organic2 and the high-transition-temperature copper oxide3 superconductors. In conventional superconductors, the electrons form superconducting Cooper pairs in a spin-singlet state, which has zero total spin (S = 0). In principle, Cooper pairs can also form in a spin-triplet state (S = 1), analogous to the spin-triplet `p-wave' state of paired neutral fermions in superfluid 3He (ref. 4). At present, the heavy-fermion compound UPt3 is the only known spin-triplet superconductor5,6, although the layered oxide superconductor Sr2RuO4 (ref. 7) is believed, on theoretical grounds8, to be a promising candidate. The most direct means of identifying the spin state of Cooper pairs is from measurements of their spin susceptibility, which can be determined by the Knight shift (as probed by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)). Here we report Knight-shift measurements of Sr2RuO2 using 17O NMR. Our results show no change in spin susceptibility on passing through the superconducting transition temperature, which provides the definitive identification of Sr2RuO4 as a spin-triplet superconductor.},

We concentrate on efforts to identify a superconducting order parameter symmetry that is compatible with all the major pieces of experimental knowledge of the material, and highlight some major discrepancies that have become even clearer in recent years. As the pun in the title suggests, we have tried to start the discussion from scratch, making no assumptions even about fundamental issues such as the parity of the superconducting state. We conclude that no consensus is currently achievable in Sr2RuO4, and that the reasons for this go to the heart of how well some of the key probes of unconventional superconductivity are really understood. This is, therefore, a puzzle that merits continued in-depth study.},

  abstract = {Phases of matter are usually identified through spontaneous symmetry breaking, especially regarding unconventional superconductivity and the interactions from which it originates. In that context, the superconducting state of the quasi-two-dimensional and strongly correlated perovskite Sr2RuO4 is considered to be the only solid-state analogue to the superfluid 3He-A phase1,2, with an odd-parity order parameter that is unidirectional in spin space for all electron momenta and breaks time-reversal symmetry. This characterization was recently called into question by a search for an expected `split' transition in a Sr2RuO4 crystal under in-plane uniaxial pressure, which failed to find any such evidence; instead, a dramatic rise and a peak in a single-transition temperature were observed3,4. Here we use nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of oxygen-17, which is directly sensitive to the order parameter via hyperfine coupling to the electronic spin degrees of freedom, to probe the nature of superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 and its evolution under strain. A reduction of the Knight shift is observed for all strain values and at temperatures below the critical temperature, consistent with a drop in spin polarization in the superconducting state. In unstrained samples, our results contradict a body of previous NMR work reporting no change in the Knight shift5 and the most prevalent theoretical interpretation of the order parameter as a chiral p-wave state. Sr2RuO4 is an extremely clean layered perovskite and its superconductivity emerges from a strongly correlated Fermi liquid, and our work imposes tight constraints on the order parameter symmetry of this archetypal system.},

  abstract  = {We introduce an algorithm for systematically improving the efficiency of parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations by optimizing the simulated temperature set. Our approach is closely related to a recently introduced adaptive algorithm that optimizes the simulated statistical ensemble in generalized broad-histogram Monte Carlo simulations. Conventionally, a temperature set is chosen in such a way that the acceptance rates for replica swaps between adjacent temperatures are independent of the temperature and large enough to ensure frequent swaps. In this paper, we show that by choosing the temperatures with a modified version of the optimized ensemble feedback method we can minimize the round-trip times between the lowest and highest temperatures which effectively increases the efficiency of the parallel tempering algorithm. In particular, the density of temperatures in the optimized temperature set increases at the ‘bottlenecks’ of the simulation, such as phase transitions. In turn, the acceptance rates are now temperature dependent in the optimized temperature ensemble. We illustrate the feedback-optimized parallel tempering algorithm by studying the two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet and the two-dimensional fully frustrated Ising model, and briefly discuss possible feedback schemes for systems that require configurational averages, such as spin glasses.},

  abstract = {The lossless current-carrying capacity of a superconductor is limited by its critical current density (Jc). A key to enhance Jc towards real-life applications is engineering defect structures to optimize the pinning landscape. For iron-based superconductors considered as candidate materials for high-field applications, high Jc values have been achieved by various techniques to introduce artificial pinning centres. Here we report extraordinary vortex pinning properties in CaKFe4As4 (CaK1144) arising from the inherent defect structure. Scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the existence of nanoscale intergrowths of the CaFe2As2 phase, which is unique to CaK1144 formed as a line compound. The Jc properties in CaK1144 are found to be distinct from other iron-based superconductors characterized by a significant anisotropy with respect to the magnetic field orientation as well as a remarkable pinning mechanism significantly enhanced with increasing temperature. We propose a comprehensive explanation of the Jc properties based on the unique intergrowths acting as pinning centres.},

  abstract = {Order-disorder transitions between glassy phases are common in nature and yet a comprehensive survey on the entailed structural changes is challenging since the constituents are in the micro-scale. Vortex matter in type-II superconductors is a model system where some of these experimental challenges can be tackled. Samples with point disorder present a glassy transition on increasing the density of vortices. A glassy yet quasi-crystalline phase, the Bragg glass, nucleates at low densities. The vortex glass stable at high densities is expected to be disordered, however its detailed structural properties remained experimentally elusive. Here we show that the vortex glass has large crystallites with in-plane positional displacements growing algebraically and short-range orientational order. Furthermore, the vortex glass has a finite and almost constant correlation length along the direction of vortices, in sharp contrast with strong entanglement. These results are important for the understanding of disorder-driven phase transitions in glassy condensed matter.},

Here we report small-angle neutron-scattering measurements of magnetic flux lines in the perovskite superconductor Sr2RuO4 (ref. 4), which is a candidate for another unconventional paired electron state---`p -wave' pairing, which has one unit of angular momentum5,6,7. We find that the magnetic flux lines form a square lattice over a wide range of fields and temperatures, which is the result predicted by a recent theory8,9 of p -wave superconductivity in Sr2RuO4. This theory also indicates that only a fraction of the electrons are strongly paired and that the orientation of the square flux lattice relative to the crystal lattice will determine which parts of the three-sheet Fermi surface of this material are responsible for superconductivity. Our results suggest that superconductivity resides mainly on the `$\gamma$' sheet9.},

  abstract     = {Among unconventional superconductors, Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ has become a benchmark for experimentation and theoretical analysis because its normal-state electronic structure is known with exceptional precision, and because of experimental evidence that its superconductivity has, very unusually, a spontaneous angular momentum, i.e. a chiral state. This hypothesis of chirality is however difficult to reconcile with recent evidence on the spin part of the order parameter. Measurements under uniaxial stress offer an ideal way to test for chirality, because under uniaxial stress the superconducting and chiral transitions are predicted to split, allowing the empirical signatures of each to be identified separately. Here, we report zerofield muon spin relaxation (ZF-$\mu$SR) measurements on crystals placed under uniaxial stresses of up to 1.05 GPa. We report a clear stress-induced splitting between the onset temperatures of superconductivity and time-reversal symmetry breaking, consistent with qualitative expectations for chiral superconductivity. We also report the appearance of unexpected bulk magnetic order under a uniaxial stress of ~ 1.0 GPa in clean Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.},

  abstract = {Sr2RuO4 has stood as the leading candidate for a spin-triplet superconductor for 26 years1. However, recent NMR experiments have cast doubt on this candidacy2,3 and it is difficult to find a theory of superconductivity that is consistent with all experiments. The order parameter symmetry for this material therefore remains an open question. Symmetry-based experiments are needed that can rule out broad classes of possible superconducting order parameters. Here, we use resonant ultrasound spectroscopy to measure the entire symmetry-resolved elastic tensor of Sr2RuO4 through the superconducting transition. We observe a thermodynamic discontinuity in the shear elastic modulus c66, which implies that the superconducting order parameter has two components. A two-component p-wave order parameter, such as px{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}ipy, naturally satisfies this requirement. As this order parameter appears to have been precluded by recent NMR experiments, we suggest that two other two-component order parameters, namely {\{}dxz,dyz{\}}and {\{}dx2−y2,gxy(x2−y2){\}}, are now the prime candidates for the order parameter of Sr2RuO4.},

CMP overlaps with many other important branches of science, such as chemistry, materials science, statistical physics, and high-performance computing. With the advancements in modern machine learning (ML) technology, a keen interest in applying these algorithms to further CMP research has created a compelling new area of research at the intersection of both fields. In this review, we aim to explore the main areas within CMP, which have successfully applied ML techniques to further research, such as the description and use of ML schemes for potential energy surfaces, the characterization of topological phases of matter in lattice systems, the prediction of phase transitions in off-lattice and atomistic simulations, the interpretation of ML theories with physics-inspired frameworks and the enhancement of simulation methods with ML algorithms. We also discuss in detail the main challenges and drawbacks of using ML methods on CMP problems, as well as some perspectives for future developments.},

We have designed and experimentally qualified a vacuum pressure impregnated, insulated, partially transposed, extruded, and roll-formed (VIPER) cable that simultaneously satisfies all of these requirements for the first time. VIPER cable critical currents are stable over thousands of mechanical cycles at extreme electromechanical force levels, multiple cryogenic thermal cycles, and dozens of quench-like transient events. Electrical joints between VIPER cables are simple, robust, and demountable. Two independent, integrated fiber-optic quench detectors outperform standard quench detection approaches. VIPER cable represents a key milestone in next-step energy generation and transmission technologies and in the maturity of HTS as a technology.},

Here we report a systematic high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES study of the normal state electronic and spin properties of BiPd. Our experimental results show the presence of a surface state at higher-binding energy with the location of Dirac point at around 700{\thinspace}meV below the Fermi level. The detailed photon energy, temperature-dependent and spin-resolved ARPES measurements complemented by our first-principles calculations demonstrate the existence of the spin-polarized surface states at high-binding energy. The absence of such spin-polarized surface states near the Fermi level negates the possibility of a topological superconducting behaviour on the surface. Our direct experimental observation of spin-polarized surface states in BiPd provides critical information that will guide the future search for topological superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric materials.},

Superconductivity was evidenced by the observation of zero resistance and a decrease of TC under external magnetic field up to 16 Tesla. This is one of the highest critical temperatures that has been achieved experimentally in any compound, along with such materials as LaH10, H3S and HgBa2CaxCu2O6+z. Our experiments show that fcc-ThH10 has stabilization pressure of 85 GPa, making this material unique among all known high-TC metal polyhydrides. Two recently predicted Th-H compounds, I4/mmm-ThH4 (>86 GPa) and Cmc21-ThH6 (86–104 GPa), were also synthesized. Equations of state of obtained thorium polyhydrides were measured and found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical calculations. New phases were examined theoretically and their electronic, phonon, and superconducting properties were calculated.},

  abstract = {One of the long-standing challenges in experimental physics is the observation of room-temperature superconductivity1,2. Recently, high-temperature conventional superconductivity in hydrogen-rich materials has been reported in several systems under high pressure3--5. An  important discovery leading to room-temperature superconductivity is the pressure-driven disproportionation of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to H3S, with a confirmed transition temperature of 203 kelvin at 155 gigapascals3,6. Both H2S and CH4 readily mix with hydrogen to form guest--host structures at lower pressures7, and are of  comparable size at 4 gigapascals. By introducing methane at low pressures into the H2S + H2 precursor mixture for H3S, molecular exchange is allowed within a large assemblage of van der Waals solids that are hydrogen-rich with H2 inclusions; these guest--host structures become the building blocks of superconducting compounds at extreme conditions. Here we report superconductivity in a photochemically transformed carbonaceous sulfur hydride system, starting from elemental precursors, with a maximum superconducting transition temperature of 287.7 {\textpm} 1.2 kelvin (about 15 degrees Celsius) achieved at 267 {\textpm} 10 gigapascals. The superconducting state is observed over a broad pressure range in the diamond anvil cell, from 140 to 275 gigapascals, with a sharp upturn in transition temperature above 220 gigapascals. Superconductivity is established by the observation of zero resistance, a magnetic susceptibility of up to 190 gigapascals, and reduction of the transition temperature under an external magnetic field of up to 9 tesla, with an upper critical magnetic field of about 62 tesla according to the Ginzburg--Landau model at zero temperature. The light, quantum nature of hydrogen limits the structural and stoichiometric determination of the system by X-ray scattering techniques, but Raman spectroscopy is used to probe the chemical and structural transformations before metallization. The introduction of chemical tuning within our ternary system could enable the preservation of the properties of room-temperature superconductivity at lower pressures.},

  abstract  = {Strong coupling between the spin and orbital degrees of freedom is crucial in generating the exotic band structure of topological insulators. The combination of spin-orbit coupling with electronic correlations could lead to exotic effects; however, these two types of interactions are rarely found to be strong in the same material. Gotlieb et al. used spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to map out the spin texture in the cuprate Bi2212. Surprisingly, they found signatures of spin-momentum locking, not unlike that seen in topological insulators. Thus, in addition to strong electronic correlations, this cuprate also has considerable spin-orbit coupling.Science, this issue p. 1271Cuprate superconductors have long been thought of as having strong electronic correlations but negligible spin-orbit coupling. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we discovered that one of the most studied cuprate superconductors, Bi2212, has a nontrivial spin texture with a spin-momentum locking that circles the Brillouin zone center and a spin-layer locking that allows states of opposite spin to be localized in different parts of the unit cell. Our findings pose challenges for the vast majority of models of cuprates, such as the Hubbard model and its variants, where spin-orbit interaction has been mostly neglected, and open the intriguing question of how the high-temperature superconducting state emerges in the presence of this nontrivial spin texture.},

  abstract = {Moir{\'e} superlattices1,2 have recently emerged as a platform upon which correlated physics and superconductivity can be studied with unprecedented tunability3--6. Although correlated effects have been observed in several other moir{\'e} systems7--17, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene remains the only one in which robust superconductivity has been reproducibly measured4--6. Here we realize a moir{\'e} superconductor in magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG)18, which has better tunability of its electronic structure and superconducting properties than magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Measurements of the Hall effect and quantum oscillations as a function of density and electric field enable us to determine the tunable phase boundaries of the system in the normal metallic state. Zero-magnetic-field resistivity measurements reveal that the existence of superconductivity is intimately connected to the broken-symmetry phase that emerges from two carriers per moir{\'e} unit cell. We find that the superconducting phase is suppressed and bounded at the Van Hove singularities that partially surround the broken-symmetry phase, which is difficult to reconcile with weak-coupling Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer theory. Moreover, the extensive in situ tunability of our system allows us to reach the ultrastrong-coupling regime, characterized by a Ginzburg--Landau coherence length that reaches the average inter-particle distance, and very large TBKT/TF values, in excess of 0.1 (where TBKT and TF are the Berezinskii--Kosterlitz--Thouless transition and Fermi temperatures, respectively). These observations suggest that MATTG can be electrically tuned close to the crossover to a two-dimensional Bose--Einstein condensate. Our results establish a family of tunable moir{\'e} superconductors that have the potential to revolutionize our fundamental understanding of and the applications for strongly coupled superconductivity.},

  abstract  = { Alchemy can't be science--common sense tells us as much. But perhaps common sense is not the best measure of what science is, or was. In this book, Bruce Moran looks past contemporary assumptions and prejudices to determine what alchemists were actually doing in the context of early modern science. Examining the ways alchemy and chemistry were studied and practiced between 1400 and 1700, he shows how these approaches influenced their respective practitioners' ideas about nature and shaped their inquiries into the workings of the natural world. His work sets up a dialogue between what historians have usually presented as separate spheres; here we see how alchemists and early chemists exchanged ideas and methods and in fact shared a territory between their two disciplines.Distilling Knowledge suggests that scientific revolution may wear a different appearance in different cultural contexts. The metaphor of the Scientific Revolution, Moran argues, can be expanded to make sense of alchemy and other so-called pseudo-sciences--by including a new framework in which "process can count as an object, in which making leads to learning, and in which the messiness of conflict leads to discernment." Seen on its own terms, alchemy can stand within the bounds of demonstrative science.},

This property can be exploited for the development of high velocity rotating bearings with no mechanical contacts and for the development of levitated trains. In this review, we focus on this latter application. After a brief description of the other techniques developed for levitating trains and the resulting achievements, we describe the magnet–superconductor interaction and recall the achievements in this field. We then give insights into the properties of the employed magnets and arrangement of magnets and we detail the characteristics and the fabrication processes of the most frequently used superconductors. Focusing on physics, we detail the procedures generally used for measuring the vertical (levitation) and the lateral (guidance) forces in magnetic levitation and the results obtained from experiments. We detail and give a critical review of the various models proposed for reproducing the force measurements. In the conclusion we discuss the possible future developments of the technology.},

  abstract = { Electric currents are commonly believed to persist in a supra-conductor without being maintained by an electromagnetic field. Thus the relation between the field strength E and the current density J in a supraconductor has sometimes been described by means of an "acceleration equation," of the form ∆J = E; A = m/ne2. (1) This equation, which might replace Ohm;s law for supraconductors, simply expresses the influence of the electric part of the Lorentz force on freely movable electrons of the mass m and charge e, the number per cm3 being n (we use rational units). By definition the constant A must be positive. As a direct consequence of this equation (1) stationary currents in supraconductors are possible when E = 0. We shall see, however, that actually equation (1), which we will refer to as the "acceleration theory," implies more than is verified by experiment; moreover, presupposing an acceleration without any friction it implies a premature theory, the development of which has presented a hopelessly insoluble problem to mathematical physicist. Apparently a model was wanted which would explain that in its most stable state the supraconductor has always a persistent current. We shall give a formulation which is somewhat more restricted in this respect. On the other had it includes one more important fact, namely, the experiment of Meissner and Ochsenfeld. In this way we get a new description of the electromagnetic field in a supraconductor, which is consistent and, as it eliminates unnecessary statements, is in closer contact with experiment. This new description seems to provide an entirely new point of view for a theoretical explanation. },

  abstract = { The penetration depth, λ, in superconducting tin at 0° K has been found to be capable of variation by the addition of impurity, 3\% of indium causing it to be nearly doubled, although the thermodynamical properties such as T c are hardly affected. It is suggested that this result throws doubt on the phenomenological theory of F. and H. London, and a new equation for the supercurrent is proposed, in which the current is related to an average of the vector potential over a region around the point considered. The size of the region is governed by a parameter ξ, which is dependent, in a similar way to the mean free path in a normal metal, on the degree of purity . The new theory agrees in a satisfactory manner with the experimental results, and also provides an explanation of the magnitude of λ in a pure metal. It has been found that the unusual anisotropy of λ in pure tin is absent in tin + 3 \% indium , and this too is in agreement with the prediction of the new theory. The fact that the temperature variation of λ appears to have the same form independent of the degree of purity implies that ξ depends on temperature in the same way as λ; this result agrees with the observed behaviour of the interphase surface energy, αns, if ξ is regarded as determining the width of the interface between superconducting and normal regions. The paper ends with a discussion of the relation of the new theory to microscopic theories of superconductivity. },

Samples withx=1 and 0.75,y>0, annealed below 900{\textdegree}C under reducing conditions, consist of three phases, one of them a perovskite-like mixed-valent copper compound. Upon cooling, the samples show a linear decrease in resistivity, then an approximately logarithmic increase, interpreted as a beginning of localization. Finally an abrupt decrease by up to three orders of magnitude occurs, reminiscent of the onset of percolative superconductivity. The highest onset temperature is observed in the 30 K range. It is markedly reduced by high current densities. Thus, it results partially from the percolative nature, bute possibly also from 2D superconducting fluctuations of double perovskite layers of one of the phases present.},

I provide a general framework for non-local Andreev phenomena in such structures in terms of coherence functions, and show how the latter link wave function and Green-function based theories.

In this article, we review the current understanding of superconductivity in heavy-fermion compounds and identify a set of characteristics that is common to their unconventional superconducting states. These core properties are compared with those of other classes of unconventional superconductors such as the cuprates and iron-based superconductors. We conclude by speculating on the prospects for future research in this field and how new advances might contribute towards resolving the long-standing mystery of how unconventional superconductivity works.},

It is an open question whether a topological material that is also a superconductor can support an edge current that consists of paired excitations. W. Wang et al. studied the Weyl superconductor molybdenum ditelluride and, using systematic transport measurements in the presence of a magnetic field, revealed the signatures of an edge supercurrent.Science, this issue p. 534Edge supercurrents in superconductors have long been an elusive target. Interest in them has reappeared in the context of topological superconductivity. We report evidence for the existence of a robust edge supercurrent in the Weyl superconductor molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). In a magnetic field B, fluxoid quantization generates a periodic modulation of the edge condensate observable as a {\textquotedblleft}fast-mode{\textquotedblright} oscillation of the critical current Ic versus B. The fast-mode frequency is distinct from the conventional Fraunhofer oscillation displayed by the bulk supercurrent. We confirm that the fast-mode frequency increases with crystal area as expected for an edge supercurrent. In addition, weak excitation branches are resolved that display an unusual broken symmetry.},
