\chapter{Field Theory Methods}

In this chapter we will give a short introduction to the use of grassmann variables
and complex numbers in the calculation of the field-integrals on the
statistical-mechanical partition function and how they can be used to transform the
expression for the action through the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.

\section{Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation}

The Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation is a transformation in the fields of a theory where a new complex field is introduced
in order to covert a term that is square and thus non-linear in an existing field variable, into a linear term in this
variable that is coupled to the new field. This is particularly useful when the existing field is Fermionic and thus
a Gra\ss mann variable since it makes it possible to consider low energy exitations of the theory by use of a saddle-point
approximation.
