\chapter{Lattice Models}

When we have a model for the free energy of a statistical mechanical system that is too complicated to
calculate analytically one approach is to utilize computers and Monte-Carlo techniques. To make numerical
methods more effective one common approach is to discretize continuous models down on a 
numerical lattice. The lattice can in principle be of any form as long as the continuum limit reproduces
the original theory, however in this thesis we will exclusively focus on a square numerical lattice
due to its simplicity.

In this chapter we will introduce different aspects of discretizing a continuous free-energy model down
on a square numerical lattice.
