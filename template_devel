Usually the way to got a custom formatting of the chapter title is to use the
titesec package, however this does not work with the KOMA Script style, therefore
we will have to do a manual overwrite of the \chapterformat and 
\chapterlinesformat commands, using \renewcommand. \chapterformat formats the
\chapter command while \chapterlinesformat formats the \chapter* command which
does not have number associated with it.

makebox[width][pos]{text}
Creates a single line box, optionally of fixed width, but otherwise large enough
to hold its content. Can be used to keep text that belongs together from begin
separated on separate line. You cannot place line breaks \\ within a makebox.

savebox{cmd}[width][pos]{text}
Formats text as if within a makebox, however instead of printing the box, it
saves it to cmd, such that the box can be printer later with \usebox immediately
followed by cmd.

\relax
Stops the expansion of the previous command. E.g. if using \\ \relax [...], it
prevents what is in the brackets from being interpreted as a dimension that would
add vertical space.

\resizebox{horizontal lenth}{vertical length}{text}
Given a size, such as 3cm, transform material to make it that size. If either
horizontal length or vertical length is an exclamation point ! then the other 
argument is used to determine a scale factor for both directions.

\thechapter
This prints the label, i.e. the number of the chapter.
